/* This file contains the definitions and documentation for the

   DEF_BUILTIN(NAME, N_ARGS, TYPE, ICODE, MASK)

   NAME:    `__builtin_arc_name' will be the user-level name of the builtin.
            `ARC64_BUILTIN_NAME' will be the internal builtin's id.
   N_ARGS:  Number of input arguments.  If special treatment is needed,
            set to -1 and handle it by hand, see arc.c:arc_expand_builtin().
   TYPE:    A tree node describing the prototype of the built-in.
   ICODE:   Name of attached insn or expander.  If special treatment in arc.c
            is needed to expand the built-in, use `nothing'.
   MASK:    CPU selector mask.  */
